# Swift-Guard Performance and Security Evaluation Methodology
## overview
This document outlines a systematic approach to evaluating the performance and security effectiveness of the Swift-Guard framework. It ensures reproducibility and objectivity of research results.

## Test Environment
### Hardward Configuration
All experiments are conducted on the following hardware:
- CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2680v4 (14 cores, 2.4GHz)
- Memory: 64GB DDR4 RAM
- Network: Intel X710 10Gbps NIC
- Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD

### Softward Configuration
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Kernel: Linux 5.15.0
- Rust: 1.70.0
- LLVM/Clang: 14.0
- libbpf: 1.2.0

## Performance Evaluation
### 1. Packet Processing Performance
Metrics:
- **Throughput**: Packets per second (PPS)
- **Latency**: Processing time (Î¼s) with average, median, P95, and P99 values
- **CPU Usage**: Percentage during packet processing

#### Resource Efficiency
- `pktgen-dpdk`: Packet generation and benchmarking
- `perf`: CPU usage and performance counter monitoring
- `bpftrace`: Detailed eBPF program analysis

#### Test Scenarios
- **Baseline**: Native network performance without security features
- **XDP Filtering**: Performance with varying filter rule complexity
- **Full Pipeline**: Combined XDP filtering and WASM inspection
- **Scalability**: Performance under increasing traffic load

### 2. Resource Efficiency
Metrics:
- **Memory Usage**: System and component-level consumption
- **CPU Efficiency**: Cycles per processed packet
- **Container Overhead**: Resource cost for dynamic instance management

## Security Effectiveness Evaluation
### 1. Threat Detection Accuracy
Metrics:
- **True Positive Rate (TPR)**: Attack detection rate
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: Normal traffic misclassification
- **F1 Score**: Precision-recall balance

#### Attack Scenarios
- **DDoS**: UDP/ICMP/SYN/HTTP Floods
- **Scanning**: Port and vulnerability scans
- **Intrusion**: Known exploit patterns and protocol violations

### 2. Mitigation Impact
Metrics:
- **Response Time**: Detection-to-action latency
- **Traffic Blocking**: Attack traffic reduction rate
- **False Positive Impact**: Service disruption due to errors

### 3. Comparative Analysis
Compare Swift-Guard with:
- **Legacy IDS/IPS** (Suricata, Snort)
- **Cloud-Native Solutions** (Cilium, Falco)
- **Traditional Firewalls**

## Automated Testing
All experiments use reproducible scripts:

```bash
# Run performance tests
$ cd tests/performance
$ ./run_benchmarks.sh

# Run security tests
$ cd tests/security
$ ./run_security_tests.sh
```
